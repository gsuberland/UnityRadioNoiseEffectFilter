# Unity Radio Noise Effect Filter
This is an audio effect filter for Unity that emulates the type of radio noise you might hear when using a handheld radio over long distances. The effect is driven via a distance parameter value (0.0 to 1.0).

A sample audio file has been included for demonstration, using a clip of [This Podcast Will Kill You](https://thispodcastwillkillyou.com/) (episode 77) as a source.
